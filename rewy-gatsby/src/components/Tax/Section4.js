                            <p>BitGo Tax supports multiple tax lot identification methods including FIFO, LIFO, Highest Cost, Lowest Cost and Average Cost. Each method can be applied either across all connected wallets, exchanges, and service providers, or on a per account basisâ€”providing true control around how tax lots are opened and closed within a portfolio. A detailed tax lot view provides insight into which specific lots are being opened or closed at an individual transaction level and offers the ability to navigate between transactions that are connected via tax lots.</p>
